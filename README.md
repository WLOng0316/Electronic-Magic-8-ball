# Electronic-Magic-8-ball
The title of the project is Electronic Magic 8-ball.  Electronic Magic 8-ball is a fortune-telling game where the user as a question and a Yes/No/Maybe type of answer will be given. The game was saved with 20 different responses. When the user presses the pushbutton, a random response will be generated and display on the LCD.

A random response from 20 saved responses was generated and display on the LCD for 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, the LCD will then display “Ask Magic 8-ball again” to invite the user to ask another question. The game will continue loop in the same way until the user plug off the power.
